# Andrew Block 
 - I am a Senior at DePaul majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development. I'm looking for a career in data analytics, project managment, or just something in technology in general as I have a passion for technology. In my free time, I love to play and watch baseball while also going on runs around Lincoln Park.
