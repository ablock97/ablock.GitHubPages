 # Andrew Block 
 * I am a Senior at DePaul majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development. I'm looking for a career in data analytics, project managment, or just something in technology in general as I have a passion for technology. In my free time, I love to play and watch baseball while also going on runs around Lincoln Park.
 * I'm excited to be apart of this class and learn more about Server Side Web Development!
